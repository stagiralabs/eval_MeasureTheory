# Lebesgue decomposition

This file proves the Lebesgue decomposition theorem. The Lebesgue decomposition theorem states that,
given two σ-finite measures `μ` and `ν`, there exists a σ-finite measure `ξ` and a measurable
function `f` such that `μ = ξ + fν` and `ξ` is mutually singular with respect to `ν`.

The Lebesgue decomposition provides the Radon-Nikodym theorem readily.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.HaveLebesgueDecomposition` : A pair of measures `μ` and `ν` is said
  to `HaveLebesgueDecomposition` if there exist a measure `ξ` and a measurable function `f`,
  such that `ξ` is mutually singular with respect to `ν` and `μ = ξ + ν.withDensity f`
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.singularPart` : If a pair of measures `HaveLebesgueDecomposition`,
  then `singularPart` chooses the measure from `HaveLebesgueDecomposition`, otherwise it
  returns the zero measure.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.rnDeriv`: If a pair of measures
  `HaveLebesgueDecomposition`, then `rnDeriv` chooses the measurable function from
  `HaveLebesgueDecomposition`, otherwise it returns the zero function.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.haveLebesgueDecomposition_of_sigmaFinite` :
  the Lebesgue decomposition theorem.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.eq_singularPart` : Given measures `μ` and `ν`, if `s` is a measure
  mutually singular to `ν` and `f` is a measurable function such that `μ = s + fν`, then
  `s = μ.singularPart ν`.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.eq_rnDeriv` : Given measures `μ` and `ν`, if `s` is a
  measure mutually singular to `ν` and `f` is a measurable function such that `μ = s + fν`,
  then `f = μ.rnDeriv ν`.
